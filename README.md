## Voice Agent

The production voice agent is disabled by default. To enable the initial
facilitation experiment, set:

```env
VOICE_AGENT_ENABLED=true
VOICE_AGENT_SILENCE_MS=1500
VOICE_AGENT_COOLDOWN_MS=15000
VOICE_AGENT_POST_AGENT_MUTE_MS=5000
VOICE_AGENT_MIN_TRANSCRIPT_CHARS=8
VOICE_AGENT_BARGE_IN_ENABLED=true
VOICE_AGENT_BARGE_IN_MIN_CHARS=2
SPEAKER_INTRO_WINDOW_MS=8000
```

Flow:

```text
Mac mic -> Soniox transcript/turn-end -> silence trigger -> gpt-realtime-2 audio -> Mac speaker
```

The agent response is not sent to the experimental viewer. Because Mac speaker
audio can be picked up by Soniox, triggers are muted while the agent is speaking
and for `VOICE_AGENT_POST_AGENT_MUTE_MS` after speech ends.

When barge-in is enabled, a mapped human speaker producing at least
`VOICE_AGENT_BARGE_IN_MIN_CHARS` of transcript while the agent is speaking
cancels the Realtime response and aborts Mac audio playback. AI and unassigned
speaker clusters do not trigger interruption.

## Speaker Setup

The experimental viewer has `Setup` and `Live` tabs.

1. Open `Setup`.
2. Enter human participant names and the AI agent name.
3. Click `Save`.
4. For each participant, click `Start Intro`.
5. The participant self-introduces. For the AI agent, the backend plays an intro from the Mac speaker.
6. When a new Soniox speaker appears, the row changes to `Candidate`.
7. Click `Confirm` to bind that speaker label to the participant.
8. Use `Live` for the transcript view.

Unknown Soniox speaker labels are shown as unassigned and do not create new
participants automatically.

The `Live` tab also shows memory-only speaking stats per mapped participant or
unassigned speaker: final utterance count, text character count, and estimated
speech time from Soniox timestamps.

## Speaker Verification Evaluation

Run the same Soniox audio segments through either speaker embedding model:

```bash
./scripts/dev.sh --speaker-model off
./scripts/dev.sh --speaker-model speechbrain
./scripts/dev.sh --speaker-model wespeaker
./scripts/dev.sh --speaker-model both
```

The first model-enabled run downloads optional dependencies and pretrained model
files. Inference runs in a dedicated process per backend so Soniox streaming is
not blocked.

Evaluation JSONL defaults to:

```text
backend/app/experiments/experiment-speaker-verification/results/evaluations.jsonl
```

Use a different path with:

```bash
./scripts/dev.sh --speaker-model both \
  --speaker-results app/experiments/experiment-speaker-verification/results/run-01.jsonl
```

Self-introduction audio is used for profile enrollment. Later mapped speaker
segments are evaluated with an expected participant id. Unassigned Soniox
clusters are scored against every available profile without an expected label.
This mode records scores and latency only; it does not automatically remap a
speaker.
